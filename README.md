# matlab_neural_net_matrix_ops
This repository shows how to train neural networks in Python and implement their forward passes in MATLAB using matrix operations. It includes feed-forward, GRU, and LSTM models and is useful for nonlinear MPC, low-level control, or gaining deeper insight into network dynamics. The project highlights transparent neural network computation.
